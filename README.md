## How to make an ~~intelligent~~ spelling corrector

This was a talk I gave at Fever Labs in Madrid - Nov. 2015. It is an adaptation of a paper made by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html), ported to Python 2.7 and with some example texts (data folder) to try different laguages. 

There is no video of the talk, but if you want to follow it, there are several ways:

* Install ipython notebooks and open the .ipnb file (recommended). There are more text and explanations than in the slides.
* Follow the [original paper](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). It's better than my talk, but it's written in Python 2.5. 

If you don't like python, there are several implementations of this algorithm in other languages [__here__](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)

### Requirements:
* python 2.7 or superior

#### Errors
There is a problem with reveal.js and I can't change the background color of the slides when exporting to pdf.
